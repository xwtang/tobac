## Reporting Bugs
Please create a new issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/tobac-project/tobac/issues) if it is not listed there, yet.

### How to write a good Bug Report?
* Give it a clear descriptive title.
* Copy and paste the error message.
* Describe the steps for reproducing the problem and give an specific example.  
* Optional: Make a suggestion to fix it. 

## How to Submit Changes
* Have a look at [our roadmap](https://github.com/tobac-project/tobac-roadmap/blob/master/tobac-roadmap-main.md) first, 
to learn about our project goals and check the 
[changelog.md](https://github.com/tobac-project/tobac/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
* More details on the code structure and further help for code contributions can be found in our [developer 
guide](https://tobac.readthedocs.io/code_structure.html)
* Before you start a pull request, please make sure that you added [numpydoc 
docstrings](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) to your 
functions. See [docstring example in the developer guide](https://tobac.readthedocs.io/contributing.html). This way the 
api documentation will be parsed properly.
* If it is a larger change or an newly added feature or workflow, please add an example in the [example 
folder](https://github.com/tobac-project/tobac/tree/main/examples) or adapt the existing examples there.
* The code should be PEP 8 compliant, as this facilitates our collaboration. Please use the first stable version (22.6.0) of [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to format your code. When you submit a pull request, all files are checked for formatting.
* The tobac repository is set up with pre-commit hooks to automatically format your code when commiting changes. Please run the command "pre-commit install" in the root directory of tobac to set up pre-commit formatting.

We aim to respond to all new issues/pull requests as soon as possible, however sometimes this is not possible due to work commitments.



## Slack
In addition to the workflow here on Github, there's a tobac workspace on Slack [tobac-dev.slack.com](tobac-dev.slack.com) that we use for some additional communication around the project. Please join us there to stay updated about all things tobac that go beyond the detailed work on the code.
